CHANGE TO CODE MODE FOR EASIER READING
# network by DJANGO

This is a "Facebook like" web. You can post your feed with one image and caption, follow and like the feeds.

First, download all the file and open it (should be in VS CODE) for easier using. 
Secondly, run these commands in your VS CODE terminal

  pip3 install django
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py runserver
Lastly, CTRL + 'click' and have an experience.
